# DartmouthMIND_tutorial
Tutorial on resting-state fMRI functional connectivity for the 2017 Dartmouth MIND summer school.

By C. Gratton, 8/10/2017

This tutorial includes a set of matlab scripts and data files for learning a few aspects of resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analyses.
The data is based off of the Midnight-Scan-Club dataset, available at:
https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000224/

There are three main components to the tutorial:
1. Making quality control grayplots
2. Make correlation matrices and spring-embedded plots
3. Calculating hub measures
